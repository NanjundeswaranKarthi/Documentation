Template Designer (TD)
======================

The Template Designer is like the **control room** where we connect the form questions (Screen Registry)  
to the blanks in the Blueprint.  

**Why is it needed?**

- The Template Designer is the **bridge** between the forms (Screen Registry) and the Blueprint.  
- This is where **data fields are connected** to document placeholders.  
- Without this mapping, **Sophiaâ€™s answers** will not end up in the right place in the document.  

**âœ… Purpose**

- Defines how users will **input data**.  
- Arranges the **screen flow** for the user.  
- Maps **screen fields** to **Data Dictionary items**.  
- Ensures that Blueprint placeholders are filled with the correct user input.  

**ðŸ”— Dependency**

- Needs both the **Blueprint (BP)** and **Data Dictionary (DD)**.  
- Uses forms from the **Screen Registry (SR)**.  

**ðŸŸ¢ Key Features**

- **Two-tab interface**:  
  - Left: Fields / UI  
  - Right: Data Mapping Panel  
- Combines:  
  - Screens from the **Registry**  
  - Content from the **Blueprint**  
- A complete template is ready to use when **all fields are linked**.  

What happens:

1. **Jackie** opens the Template Designer.  
2. **Jackie** chooses Andyâ€™s **Blueprint** to create a TD.  
3. **Jackie** links each screen field to the correct **Data Dictionary** item.  
4. Once all mappings are complete, the **template** is ready for Sophia to use.
