Screen Registry (SR)
====================

The Screen Registry is like the **form on the screen** where **Sophia** will type in answers.  

Why is it needed?
-----------------
- The Screen Registry defines these forms â€” what fields appear, their type (text, dropdown, date), and validations.  
- Without screens, Sophia has **nowhere to type her project details**.  

âœ… Purpose
----------
- Provides the **user interface** for data entry.  
- Ensures fields align with the **Data Dictionary**.  
- Adds **validations** to ensure correct data entry.  

ðŸ”— Dependency
-------------
- Depends on the **Data Dictionary (DD)** to know which fields to include.  
- Works together with the **Blueprint (BP)** for mapping placeholders to inputs.  

What happens:
-------------
1. **Jackie** creates the screens.  
2. **Jackie** adds fields that match **Andyâ€™s Data Dictionary**.
